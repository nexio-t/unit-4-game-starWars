# Unit 4 Game: Star Wars

> Game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery 

Game rules: 
* User selects desired Star Wars player, which is then moved to the "Your Character" section 
* User selects combatant from the Enemies available to attack section, which is then moved to the "Defender" section 
* User presses "Attack" button to diminsh health of defender, which also diminishes the user's own health 
* User wins if defender's health reaches zero (or lower) 
* User loses if their own health reaces zero (or lower) 
* User may optionally continue playing if they defeat on defender 

Project parameters: 
* Every Star Wars player has pre-defined health points, displayed at the bottom of the image 
* Every Star Wars player additionally has attack and counter attack values, which are disguised to the user 
* During each game, the user's attack value increments linearly by its own value (i.e., x n attacks) 

* Note: The game is bare bones and needs to be stylized with bootstrap and/or custom CSS. Game is additionally missing two pieces of functionality, namely (1) reloading the page upon game loss and (2) hiding beaten defenders and allowing user to optionally play a new defender.
